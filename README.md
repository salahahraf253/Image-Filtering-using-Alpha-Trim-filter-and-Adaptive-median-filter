# Image Filter using Alpha trim & Adaptive median filter

## Order Statistics Filters
**In image processing, filter is usually necessary to perform a high degree of noise reduction in an image before performing higher-level processing steps. The order statistics** **filter is a non-linear digital filter technique, often used to remove speckle  (salt and pepper) noise from images. We target two common filters in this project:**
---
**1.	Alpha-trim filter**
---
**2.	Adaptive median filter**
---

## **First: ** --Alpha-trim filter--
